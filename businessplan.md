## Executive Summary

A white-label SaaS platform for yacht syndicate management companies, enabling streamlined back-office operations including owner scheduling, fuel logging, expense reconciliation, maintenance tracking, and financial reporting.

---

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem

Yacht syndicates (fractional ownership arrangements) require significant administrative overhead:
- Time allocation and booking management across multiple owners
- Fuel usage tracking and cost splitting
- Maintenance scheduling and logging
- Expense reconciliation and monthly reporting
- Owner communication and document management

Current solutions are either:
- **Tied to specific syndicate companies** (Yacht Share Network, Boat Equity)
- **Geographically limited** (Boat Equity - Australia only)
- **Single-owner focused** (ShipShape, Boating Suite)
- **Generic booking tools** not purpose-built for syndication

### Market Size

#### Global Recreational Boating Market
- **USD $31-40 billion** (2024), growing at 5-10% CAGR
- Fractional ownership and sharing models identified as key growth drivers

#### Australia
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Registered vessels | ~1,000,000 |
| Licensed boat operators | 2.5 million |
| Key states | QLD (274k), NSW (241k), VIC (194k) |

#### United States
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market share (yacht) | 37.3% global ($4.61B USD) |
| Boat clubs opened (5 years) | 400+ |
| Freedom Boat Club alone | 430 locations, 100k members |

## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions

| Product | Type | Limitations |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Boat Equity | Syndicate software | Australia-only, dated UX |
| Nautical Monkey | Boat sharing platform | DIY focused, limited features |
| Yacht Share Network | Proprietary app | Tied to their managed syndicates |
| ShipShape Pro | Maintenance app | Single-owner, no syndication |
| Boating Suite | Logbook app | No multi-owner support |

### Gap in Market

No modern, white-label platform exists for syndicate **management companies** to offer their clients, featuring:
- Fair time allocation algorithms
- Per-owner fuel cost tracking
- Automated monthly reconciliation
- Branded mobile experience
- Multi-vessel fleet management
